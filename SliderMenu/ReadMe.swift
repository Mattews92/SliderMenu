 * The ContainerView controller class invokes the slider menu and handles all the
 * related animations.
 
 * Make the singleton Object of ContainerViewController as the rootViewController
 * of the AppDelegate Window to start with the slider Menu.
 
 * Replace the RootViewController with the HomeSceen ViewController and extend it
 * from BaseViewController which inturn is inherited from UIViewController. When
 * replacing the RootViewController with custom HomeScreen ViewController class,
 * replace all calls to the RootViewController class  in ContainerViewController
 * with corresponding custom class name.
 
 * Extend all the ViewControllers which should display the Slider Menu from Base
 * ViewController which inturn is inherited from UIViewController.
 
 * Customize the SlideMenu from the SliderMenuConstants.swift
